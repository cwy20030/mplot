mplot 0.4
==========

* inputs changed so that now all that's really required is
  the estimated full model - the internals extract
  data, formula, family, etc.
* variable importance plots inclided
* msc function renamed vis (this is the function that loads
  up the shiny web interfave).
* the adaptive fence procedure via af() has been made up to
  2 times faster by carefully going through the code and 
  implementing sensible defaults and reducing the number of
  times regsubsets() and bestglm() were called.
* basic (linear) mixed model functionality has been added to
  the adaptive fence function.  It essentially extracts the
  fixed part of the model and treats that as a linear model.

mplot 0.3
==========

* added basic functionality for generalised linear models
* added a d3 pairs plot implentation to the shiny interface 
  for interactive multivariate visualisation

mplot 0.2
==========

* added model selection curves

mplot 0.1
==========

* adaptive fence implementation for linear models
