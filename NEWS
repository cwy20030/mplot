mplot 0.5.5 []
------------------------

* mplot interface now uses shinydashboard
* the scatterplot matrix from the mplot shiny
  interface has now been spun off into its 
  own package: parisD3
* issue with zooming on transparent reported to 
  GoogleCharts - the workaround is to not use
  backgroundColor = 'transparent' until it is fixed
  at the source
* Reimplemented variable importance plots to 
  avoid massive memory use for moderate model
  sizes.
