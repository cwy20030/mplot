{"name":"mplot","tagline":"Model selection and stability plots","body":"# mplot\r\n\r\nThe mplot package provides a collection of functions designed for exploratory model sleection.\r\n\r\nWe implement the adaptive fence routine with sensible defaults, new graphics to highlight model selection stability and experimental automated \"best\" model selection.  It currently only supports linear and generalised linear models, however work is progressing to incorporate mixed models.\r\n\r\nThe speed of implementation comes from the leaps package and multicore support for bootstrapping.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nYou can install the development version from [Github](https://github.com/garthtarr/mplot):\r\n\r\n```s\r\nrequire(devtools)\r\ninstall_github(\"garthtarr/mplot\",quick=TRUE)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo get the most out of the mplot package, you will need a few extra packages too:\r\n\r\n```s\r\ninstall.packages(c(\"leaps\",\"googleVis\",\"foreach\",\"doMC\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```s\r\nrequire(mplot)\r\n?mplot\r\nvignette(\"mplot-guide\",package=\"mplot\")\r\nvignette(\"mplot-stepwise\",package=\"mplot\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Uninstall\r\n\r\nAfter you've used the development version you may like to remove it to avoid any potential conflicts in the future with:\r\n\r\n```s\r\ndetach(\"package:mplot\", unload=TRUE)\r\nremove.packages(\"mplot\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the next time you want to use it, you'll need to install the package again from github.\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n\r\nThe `vis` function is not yet optimised to take advantage of leaps\r\ntechnology and so it can take a while to run on moderately large data sets.\r\n\r\nWe have not done any testing on windows machines.  The multicore functionality is currently only implemented for unix-based machines (which include Macs).","google":"UA-55731407-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
