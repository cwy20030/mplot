The **knitr** package is an alternative tool to Sweave based on a
different design with more features. This document is not an introduction,
but only serves as a placeholder to guide you to the real manuals, which are
functions in this package. There is a book for this package, but
it may not be useful to those who prefer digging out information on the web.
