# A brief introduction to mplot

The **mplot** package implements a range of model selection procedures and model stability plots designed to provide users with the information they need to make informed decisions about model selection issues in linear and mixed models.

There are two main componenets: model selection via the adaptive fence procedure (Jiang et. al., 2009) and model stability curves as described in MÃ¼ller and Welsh (2010).

## Adaptive fence

The adaptive fence procedure is ... super brief recap of theory here.

### Artificial example

The adaptive fence procedure is (currently; in future it will be wrapped into the higher level `fencer` function) implemented through the function `af` as follows:


```r
require(mplot,quietly=TRUE)
op = options(gvis.plot.tag = "chart")
n = 100
set.seed(11)
e = rnorm(n)
x0 = 1
x1 = rnorm(n)
x2 = rnorm(n)
x3 = x1^2
x4 = x2^2
x5 = x1*x2
y = x0 + x1 + x2 + e
dat = data.frame(y,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5)
lm1 = lm(y~., data=dat)
af1 = af(lm1, n.cores=3)
```

```

```

## Call:
## af(mf = lm1, n.cores = 3)
## 
## Adaptive fence model (c*=18.8):
## y ~ x1 + x2
## 
## Model sizes considered: 1 to 6 (including intercept).
```


```r
plot(af1)
```

```
