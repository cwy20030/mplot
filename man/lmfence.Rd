\title{The fence procedure for linear models}
\usage{
lmfence(fixed, data, cstar, nvmax, method = "ML", exhaustive = FALSE,
  use.leaps = TRUE, adaptive = TRUE, trace = TRUE, best.only = FALSE,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{fixed}{an object of class \code{\link[stats]{formula}}
specifying the full model that can be fitted.}

\item{data}{a data frame containing the variables in the full
model.  Currently this is required.  Future development will
look at the \code{lm} function to replicate functionality,
whereby if \code{data} is missing or variables are not found
in \code{data}, the variables are taken from
\code{environment(formula)}, typically the
environment from which \code{lmfence} is called.}

\item{cstar}{the boundary of the fence, typically found
through bootstrapping.}

\item{nvmax}{the maximum number of variables that will be
be considered in the model (the default is the number of
explanatory variables in \code{fixed}).}

\item{method}{the model selection method to be used. Currently
only \code{method = "ML"} is supported (perhaps in the future
\code{method = "MVC"} will be implemented).}

\item{exhaustive}{logical. If \code{TRUE} the search for a best
model contines through the entire model space and returns
all models that passed the hurdle at all model sizes
(rather than stopping at the smallest possible model that
passes the fence hurdle).  It was something Garth used in
development priorto the incorporating leaps functionality and
should probably be retired.}

\item{use.leaps}{logical. If \code{TRUE} the \code{regsubsets}
function from the \code{leaps} package is used to find the best
candidate model at each dimension.  Then the fence criteria is
sequentially applied to each of these "best" models.  Once a
candidate model is found, other models at that dimension are
checked.  Garth can't think of a reason why this wouldn't always
be the preferred option - so perhaps the full search code
should be retired and use.leaps removed as an option (forced
\code{TRUE}).  Note that if the number of parameters is large
it is required that \code{use.leaps = TRUE}.}

\item{adaptive}{logical. If \code{TRUE} the boundary of the fence is
given by cstar.  Otherwise, it the original (non-adaptive) fence
is performed where the boundary is cstar*hat(sigma)_{M,tildeM}.}

\item{trace}{logical. If \code{TRUE} the function prints out its
progress as it iterates up through the dimensions.}

\item{best.only}{logical.  If \code{TRUE} the function returns
only one model - the "best" one at the smallest model size for
which there is (at least) one candidate that passes the fence.
Otherwise it returns all candidate models which pass the fence
at that model size.}

\item{...}{optional extra parameters passed through (?? necessary)}
}
\description{
This function implements the fence procedure to
find the best linear model.  STILL NEED TO ADD IN THE OPTION
TO FORCE VARIABLES INTO THE MODEL (THIS SHOULD BE EASY TO
IMPLEMENT).

n = 40 # sample size
beta = c(1,2,3,0,0)
K=length(beta)
set.seed(198)
X = cbind(1,matrix(rnorm(n*(K-1)),ncol=K-1))
e = rnorm(n)
y = X\%*\%beta + e
dat = data.frame(X[,-1])
# Non-adaptive approach (not recommended)
